The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1, and the sequence continues as follows:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

This function works by recursively calling itself to calculate the Fibonacci numbers n - 1 and n - 2, and then adding those two numbers together.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as it does forward. For example, the words "racecar" and "madam" are palindromes.

This function works by recursively calling itself to check if the substring of the string from index 1 to index str.length() - 1 is a palindrome. The base case is when the string has a length of 1 or less, in which case the string is a palindrome.

Factorial
The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, 5 factorial (5!) is 120, because 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

This function works by recursively calling itself to calculate the factorial of the number n - 1. The base case is when n is 0, in which case the factorial is 1.
